<h3>Welcome to my Page<h3>
I am currently working through The Odin Project and as of today I completed the <a href="https://num1learner007.github.io/odin-recipes/">Recipes</a> exercise. I appreciate how The Odin Project creates a space that is more than spoon feeding the user or getting me to copy paste code and BAM! "I did it". I can tell I am getting a lot out of the project and look forward to updating this while working on the next project.
